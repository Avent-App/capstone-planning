## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Made huge progress on the app, finished our user stories early (within the first 3 days of the week). As well as sucessfully including features that were not planned properly in the first week, in other words, planning and executing important features AFTER already completing this weeks user stories, amazing progress. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Deciding what to do after finally finishing the user stories. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished everythign planned for the week, keeping us on track for the project. Actually we finished more than expected.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Absolutely, the biggest resources were the teachers, Moe, Beck and Nick, by far. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

None so far are at risk.
