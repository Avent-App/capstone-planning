# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Daniel Ortiz, David Barcenas, Eva Sennrich**

## Problem Statement

How to have fun in a new city? This is a problem every intern will deal with, so we will build an event search + social app specifically for professional interns who are looking to have fun AND network with other interns from other companies, best of both worlds. 

## Description
**What is the main purpose of your project?**

To provide networking and excursion opportunities for professional interns looking to connect with other interns in their city, providing exploring opportunities, and help them break the ice with their own cohorts through engaging activities outside of work. As well as to provide a platform for buisnesses to seamlessly plan events for the intern cohorts of their own, guaranteed to be fun by us. 

**What are the key features your site has to offer its users?**

Ability to scroll, search and discover activities in their city, provide recommendations for weekend plans, such as "do x, followed by y, then z" on a Saturday with their cohort, geared towards team-building and networking. 

We will also provide an interface for small buisnesses to advertise their events on our platform (think eventBrite), but further we can leverage these connections to connect larger companies with small buisnesses to plan intern events of their own. 

There will also be a social component, where you can connect and message other people on the platform, as a way to network with other interns either at your own company, or others. You can even add previous events or favorite spots to your profile, to boost small buisness visibility and provide ideas to other interns who haven't discovered your attended event yet.  
**
How will your targeted audience use your website?**

Interns in general, Tech or otherwise. 

## Expected Features List

- Create filters for a business, vs personal, vs public event.

- create categories for type of events → boil down a “describable” event into one of a few categories, and apply recommendations based on the “fundamental” category.

- Suggested content/events for people who are registered and have a user profile.

- Way to search for similar events with keywords. (AI recommendations)

- Ability to join a thread for the event. Talk to others that are interested in participating and RSVP directly with the event host.

- Feature to rate hosts based on their performance.

- Hosts may have a profile with pictures of previous events that they have hosted.

- Users may need to be approved by host to attend event and gather more information like address.

- Way to create a private or public event.

- Private events may be visible by link only or by those that follow you.

- The app should allow users to post updates and photos about events

- Users should be able to see who is attending events (user can make this public or private for privacy reasons)

- The ability to save events to a calendar or to-do list

- The feature to see events near you on a map.

- The feature to rate and review events

- The feature to make events paid or free. Can buy tickets directly through the app.

- Users can “retweet” the events they’re joining to their followers.

**THESE WILL BE SPLIT INTO CORE AND STRETCH FEATURES**

## Related Work

Eventbrite, The Nudge, All Events in City, Unation, Ticketmaster, Meetup, Gametime.

We will be different as we are catering specifically towards professional interns, as well as leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (AI) models in our infrastructure for recommendations, advanced autocompletion for event creators, generated ideas on what to do in your city, etc. 

## Open Questions

**What questions do you still have?**

What we should make core features, what we should make stretch features, how can we know how long a feature should take, or at least an approximation.

**What topics do you need to research more for your project?**

How to handle payments and physical money passing through our system.

How to Deploy using Heroku (but we should be learning this soon)

How to provide recommendations and how to populate our database with other companies (for our capstone we would probably just use dummy data but this would still be interesting.)
