# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Daniel Ortiz, David Barcenas, Eva Sennrich**

## Problem Statement

How to have fun in a new city? This is a problem every intern will deal with, so we will build an event search + social app specifically for professional interns who are looking to have fun AND network with other interns from other companies, best of both worlds. 

## Description
**What is the main purpose of your project?**

To provide networking and excursion opportunities for professional interns looking to connect with other interns in their city, providing exploring opportunities, and help them break the ice with their own cohorts through engaging activities outside of work. As well as to provide a platform for buisnesses to seamlessly plan events for the intern cohorts of their own, guaranteed to be fun by us. 

**What are the key features your site has to offer its users?**

Ability to scroll, search and discover activities in their city, provide recommendations for weekend plans, such as "do x, followed by y, then z" on a Saturday with their cohort, geared towards team-building and networking. 

We will also provide an interface for small buisnesses to advertise their events on our platform (think eventBrite), but further we can leverage these connections to connect larger companies with small buisnesses to plan intern events of their own. 

There will also be a social component, where you can connect and message other people on the platform, as a way to network with other interns either at your own company, or others. You can even add previous events or favorite spots to your profile, to boost small buisness visibility and provide ideas to other interns who haven't discovered your attended event yet.  
**
How will your targeted audience use your website?**

Interns in general, Tech or otherwise. 

## Expected Features List



**THESE WILL BE SPLIT INTO CORE AND STRETCH FEATURES**

## Related Work

Eventbrite, The Nudge, All Events in City, Unation, Ticketmaster, Meetup, Gametime.

We will be different as we are catering specifically towards professional interns, as well as leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (AI) models in our infrastructure for recommendations, advanced autocompletion for event creators, generated ideas on what to do in your city, etc. 

## Open Questions

**What questions do you still have?**

What we should make core features, what we should make stretch features, how can we know how long a feature should take, or at least an approximation.

**What topics do you need to research more for your project?**

How to handle payments and physical money passing through our system.

How to Deploy using Heroku (but we should be learning this soon)

How to provide recommendations and how to populate our database with other companies (for our capstone we would probably just use dummy data but this would still be interesting.)
